## Disclaimer
Hi, to all of the Comp Sci people reading this: don't. This is not a course or an expert explanation, this is a quick and dirty explanation of the improtant stuff for using the programs described at the beginning. You're not going to like this and probably have many complaints. This is not a professional way to show anyone anything or help anyone acutally code anything effective. This is solely a crash course in how to search the important terms for scientific coding. My goal here is to set up someone to convince themselves that they have set up the environment for running someone else's code and be able to search the keywords to troubleshoot their own. I won't be explaining the difference between recursion and iteration. I don't understand it myself and haven't needed it to get this far.

## What is Code?
Code is a list of instructions. There's a misconception that coding is all math -math can certainly help sometimes. A piece of code is the minimum list of instructions needed to get a computer to achieve a task. Thats why a coding diagram looks like this:

If you were a bit math-hesitant like I was growing up, great! The computer will do it for you now. As a mater of fact, it can perform mathematical calculations at speeds unthinkable to the human brain. Beat the calculator? Only when a person is typing in the numbers.

## Hello World
As is tradition, I will now give your first piece of code. This is typically only a line long. It's asking the computer to say "Hello World" back to you. [It's a fun piece of comp sci history you get to be a part of!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

## üåç Hello World in 4 Languages
Google Sheets
```excel
="Hello, World!"
```
RStudio
```R
print("Hello, World!")
```
Python
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

As you can see, there's always more than just typing in the phrase "Hello, World!." The text around the words is the code, our instructions to tell the computer to "Say the following:" What I find particularly striking is how much we can actually learn from the juxtaposition of the 4. First, as you are well aware, Google Sheets was built for visualizing spreadsheets and doing calculations. As such, it starts with an "=" and the fact that we're working with text and not numbers has to be denoted. Second, both Python and RStudio are so-called "Interpretable Languages." You can tell the computer to print out a word and the function that does it is "print." Excellent. This is intuitive. C++ wasn't designed to be intuitive or user-friendly. It was designed for speed. We talked about this before, but this is the key to picking your programming language. It has to be familiar to you and the code user to make sure your instructions are correct, but there may be lists of instructions that are so long and complex that making the computer translate out the "print" function back into computer speak and binary will preclude your ability to complete the list in a reasonable amount of time.
