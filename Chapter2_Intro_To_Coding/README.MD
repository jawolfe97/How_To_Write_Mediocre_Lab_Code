## Disclaimer
Hi, to all of the Comp Sci people reading this: don't. This is not a course or an expert explanation, this is a quick and dirty explanation of the improtant stuff for using the programs described at the beginning. You're not going to like this and probably have many complaints. This is not a professional way to show anyone anything or help anyone acutally code anything effective. This is solely a crash course in how to search the important terms for scientific coding. My goal here is to set up someone to convince themselves that they have set up the environment for running someone else's code and be able to search the keywords to troubleshoot their own. I won't be explaining the difference between recursion and iteration. I don't understand it myself and haven't needed it to get this far.

## What is Code?
Code is a list of instructions. There's a misconception that coding is all math -math can certainly help sometimes. A piece of code is the minimum list of instructions needed to get a computer to achieve a task. Thats why a coding diagram looks like this ![Coding Diagram for Replacing a Lightbulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart#/media/File:LampFlowchart.svg) and not like this ![Math, Gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_expression#/media/File:Algebraic_equation_notation.svg)
