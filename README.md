# How To Write Mediorcre Lab Code

Welcome to the this series of articles! I'll be working on this project continuiously and the goal here is in line with that of other introductory coding projects such as [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), to address one fundamental problem: we're all busy in lab. 

These days researchers are expected to be experts in data management, inventory, data analysis, numerical simulaiton, API query, high thoughput arithmatic calculation, experimental design, note taking, and many many more tasks. In the average biochemistry lab, there are a million things to do and the tasks are both varied and repetitive. Often lab automation allows for the generation of so many datasets in a single day that simple tasks like opening and closing files can transform into a tedious hours-long endeavor.

If you're like me, your computer scientist and computational chemist friends will tell you to "just code something." Of course. But you then find that the code you write is hard to interpret on a second pass. Maybe it has too many user inputs to always be useful, or better yet the data is in a valid -slightly different format this time- and the code you wrote doesn't actually work this time. My favorite problem is trying to get your co-worker to run it on their computer. What libraries did you need? How did I install them again? You end spending about as much time (if not more time) editing code as you would have spent analyzing and formatting data. 

I was lucky to have taken two introductory coding for sicence major seminars and courses and it has really propelled my career and made my time in lab much easier. From training new hires to supporting your hypotheses with numerical simulation, I strongly believe there is no problem that can't be solved with a good piece of code (an excel sheet counts too).

In this onging project, I want to give you some introductory tools from those classes and short-cuts from a PhD chemist about how to code in a way that will actually save you time. Hopefully this will help build up a code base and logistical toolkit for you to build your own code and write instructions that both people and computers can use to make your tasks much faster and help everyone get out of lab a little faster every day. 

## Coding List
We will cover examples of logistical improvements in lab using the following "Coding Languages," when applicable: 
* Avoiding Coding Altogether (Phyiscal Systems)
* Google Sheets, Basically Free Microsoft Excel with a Few Mising 
    -[Only Available Online](https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/)
* RStudio
    - [Web Browser](https://posit.cloud/)
    - [Download](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html#rstudio)
* Python
    - [Web Browser](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)
    - [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* C++ (I'll be learning with you!)
    -[Web Browser](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
    -[Download](https://isocpp.org/get-started)
* Generall Command Line (Windows, Unix, and Linux)
The above links are to online ways of running and editing code through your internet browser where available, and for downloading programs when possible.

## Anticipated Scope
This will likely change as time goes on and as I get feedback, but here is how I plan to organize the articles and I'll log the progress down below.
