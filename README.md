# How To Write Mediorcre Lab Code
Primarily a series of readme articles describing important considerations ranging from scope, usability, automation, and user interface. Organized by typical lab task, written in as many coding languages as I can manage.

Welcome to the this series of articles! I'll be working on this project continuiously and the goal here is in line with that of other introductory coding projects such as Automate the Boring Stuff, to address one fundamental problem: we're all busy in lab. Data management, inventory, data analysis, numerical simulaiton, API query, arithmatic calculation, experimental design, note taking, and many many more tasks. In the average biochemistry lab, there are a million things to do and the tasks are both varied and repetitive. Often expensive lab automation allows for the generation of many datasets in a day and simple tasks like opening and closing files transforms into a tedious hours long endeavor.

If you're like me, your computer scientist frients will tell you to "just code something." Of course. But you then find that the code you write is hard to interpret on a second pass. Maybe it has too many user inputs to be useful, or better yet the data is in a valid -slightly different format this time- and the code you wrote doesn't actually work this time. My favorite is trying to get your friend to run it on their computer. What libraries did you need? How did I install them again? You end up just spending about as much time editing codde as you would have spent analyzing and formatting data. 

I was lucky to have taken a few introductory coding for sicence major seminars and courses and it has really propelled my career and made my time in lab much easier. From training new hires to supporting your hypotheses with numerical simulation, I strongly believe there is no problem that can't be solved with a good piece of code (an excel sheet counts too).

In this project, I want to give you some tools from expert computer scientists and short-cuts from a PhD chemist about how to code in a way that will actually save you time. Hopefully this will help build up a code base for you to build your own code and write instructions that both people and computers can use to make your tasks much faster and help everyone get out of lab a little faster every day.
